# PKMN-Fusion-Python
This is the repository for Pokemon Fusion MUCK Version Made in Python 3

This is related to https://github.com/Koden02/PKMN-Fusion.

The idea of this project is currently to write the combat code that will be tied into Evennia once complete.  The expectation is that this will take quite a bit of time to complete, so the developments are being done for Evennia version 0.9 that uses Python 3.
